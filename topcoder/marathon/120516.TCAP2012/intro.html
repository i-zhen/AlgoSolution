<p>In the year 360 B.C. or thereabouts, Plato published Timaeus, through which Plato presents his 
own theory of everything, with geometry playing a central role in those ideas. And it is there, in 
ancient Greece, our story begins. </p>

<p>Aristotle argued as much in his treatise On the Heavens: "A magnitude if divisible one way is a line, 
if two ways a surface, and if three a body. Beyond these there is no other magnitude, because the 
three dimensions are all that there are." <a href="#ref1">1</a> In A.D. 150, Ptolemy tried to prove that four dimensions 
are impossible, insisting that you cannot draw four mutually perpendicular lines. His argument, 
however, was less a rigorous proof than a reflection of our inability both to visualize and to draw in 
four dimensions. </p>

<p>One of the first big breakthroughs in charting higher-dimensional space came courtesy of Rene 
Descartes, who taught us that thinking in terms of coordinates rather than pictures can be 
extremely productive. For with his coordinate system in hand, it became possible to use algebraic 
equations to describe complex, higher-dimensional geometric figures that are not readily 
visualized. </p>

<p>The great German mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann took off with this idea two 
centuries later and carried it far. In the 1850s, while working on the geometry of curved (non-Euclidean) spaces, Riemann realized that these spaces were not restricted in terms of the number 
of dimensions. However, Riemann's advanced mathematics had simply outpaced the physics of 
his era, and it takes another fifty years or so -- for the physicists, or at least one physicist in 
particular, to catch up. </p>

<p><img src="pic1.png" style="float: right;"></img> The one who did was Albert Einstein. In developing his 
special theory of relativity, Einstein drew on an idea 
that was also being explored by the German 
mathematician Hermann Minkowski, namely, that time 
is inextricably intertwined with the three dimensions of 
space, forming a new geometrical construct known as 
spacetime. In an unexpected turn, time itself came to 
be seen as the fourth dimension that Riemann had 
incorporated decades before in his elegant equations. </p>

<p>Curiously, the British writer H. G. Wells had anticipated 
this same outcome ten years earlier in his novel The 
Time Machine. As explained by the Time Traveller, 
"there are really four dimensions, three which we call 
the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time". <a href="#ref2">2</a> 
Minkowski said pretty much the same thing in a 1908 
speech: "Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, 
are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality." <a href="#ref3">3</a> It thus takes four coordinates to
describe an event in four-dimensional spacetime (x, y, z, t).</p>

<p>In Einstein's theory, it takes ten numbers -- or ten fields -- to precisely describe the workings of 
gravity in four dimensions. The force can be represented most succinctly by taking those ten 
numbers and arranging them in a four-by-four, with ten of the sixteen entries are independent. 
Kaluza had basically taken Einstein's general theory of relativity and added an extra dimension to it 
by expanding the four-by-four matrix to a five-by-five one. By expanding spacetime to the fifth 
dimension, Kaluza was able to take the two forces known at the time, gravity and 
electromagnetism, and combine them into a single, unified force. To an observer in the five-dimensional world that Kaluza envisioned, those forces would be one and the same, which is what 
we mean by unification. But in a four-dimensional world, the two can't go together; they would 
appear to be wholly autonomous. You could say that's the case simply because both forces do not 
fit into the same four-by-four matrix. The additional dimension, however, provides enough extra 
elbow room for both of them to occupy the same matrix and hence be part of the same, more all-encompassing force. </p>

<p>In 1926 from Oskar Klein, the Swedish physicist who carried Kaluza's idea a step further. Drawing 
on quantum theory, Klein actually calculated the size of the compact dimension, arriving at a 
number that was tiny indeed -- close to the so-called Planck length, which is about as small as you 
can get -- around 10^30 cm in circumference. <a href="#ref4>4</a> And that is how a fifth dimension could exist, yet 
remain forever unobservable. After sitting on Kaluza's original paper for more than two years, 
Einstein wrote back saying he liked the idea "enormously". <a href="#ref5">5</a> In fact, he liked the idea enough to 
pursue Kaluza-Klein-inspired approaches off and on over the next twenty years. But ultimately, 
Kaluza-Klein theory was cast aside while the quantum revolution was beginning to take hold. </p>

<p>General relativity, the geometry-based theory that encapsulates our current understanding of 
gravity, has also held up extraordinarily well since Einstein introduced it in 1915, passing every 
experimental test it has faced. And quantum theory beautifully describes three of the known forces: 
the electromagnetic, weak, and strong. Predictions of the behavior of an electron in the presence 
of an electric field, for example, agree with measurements to ten decimal points. Unfortunately, 
these two very robust theories are totally incompatible. It's hardly an ideal state of affairs when 
your two most successful theories -- one describing large objects such as planets and galaxies, 
and the other describing tiny objects such as electrons and quarks -- combine to give you gibberish. 
Keeping them separate is not a satisfactory solution, either, because there are places, such as 
black holes, where the very large and very small converge, and neither theory on its own can make 
sense of them. "There shouldn't be laws of physics," Strominger maintains. "There should be just 
one law and it ought to be the 
nicest law around." <a href="#ref6">6</a> </p>

<p><img src="pic2.png" style="float: right;"></img> That is the promise of string 
theory, an intriguing tough 
unproven approach to 
unification that replaces the 
pointlike objects of particle 
physics with extended (though 
still quite tiny) objects called 
strings. Like the Kaluza-Klein 
approaches that preceded it, string theory assumes that extra dimensions beyond our everyday
three (or four) are required to combine the forces of nature. Most versions of the theory hold that, 
altogether, ten or eleven dimensions (including time) are needed to achieve this grand synthesis.  </p>

<p>String theory takes the old Kaluza-Klein idea of one hidden "extra" dimension and expands it 
considerably. If we were to take a detailed look at our four-dimensional spacetime, as depicted by 
the line in this figure, we'd see it's actually harboring six extra dimensions, curled up in an intricate 
though minuscule geometric space known as a Calabi-Yau manifold. More will be said about these 
spaces in the book The Shape of Inner Space. </p>

<p>I may get in trouble for saying this, but I believe that only a mathematician, would have been bold 
enough to think that higher-dimensional space would afford us special insight into phenomena that 
we've so far only managed to observe in a lower-dimensional setting. And only a computer 
scientist would have been bold enough to explore. Therefore comes our problem. </p>
